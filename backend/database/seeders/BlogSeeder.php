## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

## Types of Cloud Services

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Virtual machines
- Storage systems
- Networking components
- Operating systems

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Development environments
- Database management systems
- Business intelligence services
- Application hosting

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Email and collaboration tools
- Customer relationship management
- Enterprise resource planning
- Content management systems

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

1. **Cost Reduction**: Pay only for what you use
2. **Scalability**: Easily scale resources up or down
3. **Flexibility**: Access from anywhere with internet connection
4. **Reliability**: Built-in redundancy and backup systems
5. **Security**: Advanced security measures and compliance

## Leading Cloud Providers

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform
- IBM Cloud

## Best Practices for Cloud Migration

1. Assess your current infrastructure
2. Choose the right cloud model
3. Plan for security and compliance
4. Train your team
5. Monitor and optimize costs
